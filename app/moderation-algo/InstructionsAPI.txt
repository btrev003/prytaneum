Here are three stages available to use with the moderation app: 1) extracting topics and definitions from the reading materials, 2) interactively finalizing the list of topics and definitions, and 3) running live questions through the moderation algorithm.
 
Stage 1: Extracting the topics and definitions from reading materials.
request = {
	'stage': 'extraction',
	'reading_materials': 'The text of the entire reading materials...'
}
response = {
	'issue':'Overall issue discussed in the reading materials',
	'topics': {
		'topic1': 'definition1',
		'topic2': 'definition2',
		...
	}
}
 
Stage 2: Interactively choose a set of topics and definitions to classify questions into.
NOTE: It is assumed that the user already went through Stage 1 to create an initial list of topics.
Possible actions to take are: lock, lock_many, unlock, unlock_many, rename, add, remove, remove_many, regenerate.
request = {
	'stage': 'interactive',
	'action': 'action_to_take',
	'selected_topic': 'Name of the selected topic' # Required for: lock, unlock, rename, add, remove
	'selected_topics': [ # Required for: lock_many, unlock_many, remove_many
		'topic1',
		'topic2',
		...
	]
	'new_topic': 'Name of the new topic' # Required for: rename, add
	'new_definition': 'Definition of the new topic' # Required for: rename add
}
response = {
	'topics': {
		'topic1': 'definition1',
		'topic2': 'definition2',
		...
	},
	'locked_topics': [
		'topic1',
		'topic4',
		...
	]
}
 
 
Stage 3: Process a question through the moderation algorithm.
request = {
	'stage': 'moderation',
	'question': 'The question to process'
}
response = {
	'question_en': 'The question in English',
	'question_es': 'The question in Spanish',
	'original_lang': 'Original language of the question as a two-letter code',
	'substantive': True/False,
	'offensive': True/False,
	'relevant': True/False,
	'topics': {
		'topic1': True/False,
		'topic2': True/False,
		...
	}
}
